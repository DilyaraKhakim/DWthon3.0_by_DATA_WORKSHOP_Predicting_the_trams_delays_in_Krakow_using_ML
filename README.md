# DWthon3.0_by_DATA_WORKSHOP_Predicting_the_trams_delays_in_Krakow_using_ML
The final version of the code that I used while participating the event DWthon3.0 organised by DATA Workshop (https://dataworkshop.eu; https://dataworkshop.ru) in the 30-31st of October, 2021. DWthon3.0 was dedicated to finding ways how to predict the trams delays in Krakow, Poland, using Machine Learning (also the competition on Kaggle was held). There was used the real data describing the trams delays in Krakow.
